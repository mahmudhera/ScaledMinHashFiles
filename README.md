### Mathematical calculation of the expectation of the probability of the pathological cases
Pathological case means when our calculations fail. They fail when there is nothing common in the sketches (sketches drawn from the set of original k-mers and the set of mutated k-mers). Mathematically, it comes down to calculating the moment generating function of L-N_mut in the range [0, L].
